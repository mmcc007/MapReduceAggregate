Mapreduce Aggregate Test Harness
=======================
This is a basic [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) aggregate example that builds with [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) and uses [MRUnit](http://incubator.apache.org/projects/mrunit.html) for unit testing.

To run tests and build jar do
'mvn install'

You can then run the jar file on your hadoop cluster
